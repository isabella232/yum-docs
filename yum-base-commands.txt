Basic Yum Commands and how to use them:

1. yum list [available|installed|extras|updates|obsoletes|all|recent] [pkgspec]

   This command lets you list packages in any repository enabled on your 
   system or installed. It also lets you list specific types of packages as
   well as refine your list with a package specification of any of the package's
   name, arch, version, release, epoch.

   
   yum list:

   By default 'yum list' without any options will list all packages in all the
   repositories and all the packages installed on your system.
   Note: 'yum list all' and 'yum list' give the same output.

   yum list available:
   Lists all the packages available to be installed in any enabled repository
   on your system. 

   yum list installed:
   This is equivalent to rpm -qa. It lists all the packages installed on 
   the system.

   yum list extras:
   This command lists any installed package which no longer appears in any
   of your enabled repositories. Useful for finding packages which linger
   between upgrades or things installed not from a repo.

   yum list obsoletes:
   This command lists any obsoleting relationships between any available package
   and any installed package.

   yum list updates:
   This command lists any package in an enabled repository which is an update
   for any installed package.

   yum list recent:
   This command lists any package added to any enabled repository in the last
   seven(7) days.

   yum list pkgspec:
   This command allows you to refine your listing for particular packages.
   
   Examples of pkgspecs:
   yum list zsh
   yum list joe\*
   yum list \*.i386
   yum list dovecot-1.0.15
